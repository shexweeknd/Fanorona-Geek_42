## Project Overview

For this project. We decided to code a popular Malagasy game called `Fanorona`.

The game consists of two players, opposing each other.

### Strategy

The game is played on a board of `3x3`, `5x5` or `9x5`. In which the first digit represents the number of column, and the second represent its number of lines.

The game has two sides, composed of stones (or any item which can represent the pawns). The white and black pawns take alternate turns, starting with white in order to capture the opposing pieces.

There are two kinds of moves:

- A non-capturing move, which is called a `paika`.
- And a capturing move.

### End conditions

The game ends when one of the players captures all opponent's stones.

Or, if neither player can achieve this, the game is a draw.

## Challenges

We faced the challenge of creating a simple game, yet enjoyable. The goal is to be able to play the game from two different computers, by transmitting data through a server which will display the board on each client's side.
